    "*Combinatorial optimization refers to algorithmic search for a combination of design decisions that best meets stated design objectives. Published applications in HCI include keyboards, menu systems, graphical user interfaces, information visualizations, and input methods. In this block, we first learn three basic concepts: design space (feasible set), objective function, and search method. A plain vanilla black box optimizer implements these principles in a practical manner. Our exercises apply it in layout design tasks of increasing difficulty. In the latter part, we focus on heuristic methods for improving search performance. The last part looks at advanced topics, such as the design of multi-objective, robust, and dynamic methods.*\n",

To *design interaction* is about improving design decisions algorithmically in the light of best information on what makes interaction good for users.\n",

    "# 2. Basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial optimization insists on defining a **design task**, consisting of:\n",
    "1. **search space** (design space implemented in code; aka feasible set, candidate set), which is a finite set of alternative designs; \n",
    "2. **objective function**, which defines what you mean by 'good' or 'desirable design';\n",
    "3. **task instance**, which sets task-specific parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A task defined like this can then be attacked by a **solver**, which goes through the design space to find increasingly better designs. We use this structure in the following exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/optimization.png\" width=\"95%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design task\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain words, the task is to find the design that yields the highest value of a given objective (goodness) function. This function captures assumptions and knowledge about what makes a design 'good':\n",
    "$$\\max_{d \\in D} f (d)$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "* $d$ is **a candidate design**, \n",
    "* $D$ is the set of all feasible designs, or **design space** (search space), and\n",
    "* $f (\\mathbf{x})$ is **the objective function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this definition is not actionable. Why? Because it does not expose the structure of the design space. The following definition makes **the combinatorial structure of design** more explicit:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Find } \\mathbf{x} =\n",
    "\t\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "\tx_1 \\\\\n",
    "\tx_2 \\\\\n",
    "\t\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "\tx_n\n",
    "\t\\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbf{X}\n",
    "\\mbox{ which maximizes } f(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "where \n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}$ is an *n*-dimensional **design vector**,  each dimension describing a **design variable**, and\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{X}$ is **the set of feasible designs** (all vectors that fulfill constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain words, a design is a vector in a multi-dimensional vector space. The objective function assigns each vector a value describing its goodness (or badness). When we optimize, we are looking for the vectors that obtain the highest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design space\n",
    "\n",
    "A design space is the product of design variables under consideration. In a real design problem, some variables are fixed, but some are open. **A design variable** can capture such open decision using familiar types of variables, such as:\n",
    "* boolean (e.g., Do we offer auditory feedback for button press or not?)\n",
    "* integer (e.g., position of an element on x-axis)\n",
    "* real (e.g., hue)\n",
    "* categorical (e.g., type of an element).\n",
    "\n",
    "In combinatorial optimization continuous variables are discretized. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all designs in a design space obtained this way are technically feasible. Consider a hierarchical menu, where a submenu might not be reachable from the top. Functional and other requirements that 'rule out' candidate designs are collectively called **design constraints** ([example](imgs/not-feasible.jpg)). Another example: When designing a Web layout, we should not place elements such that they overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis of problem size\n",
    "\n",
    "The first benefit of this approach is visible now: Defining a design space -- as opposed to presuming it -- allows examining its size and structure. When we start doing this for UI design problems, we quickly realize that **design spaces in HCI are often exceedingly large**. For example, for $n$ functionality there are $2^n - 1$ ways to combine them to an application, which for only 50 functions means 1,125,899,906,842,623 possibilities. Further, assuming that 50 have been selected, they can be organized into a hierarhical menu in $100! \\approx 10^{158}$ ways. [Combinatorics](https://www.tug.org/texshowcase/cheat.pdf) can be used to analyze problem sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function $f( \\mathbf{x} )$ states what makes a design good. Technically, it is a function that assigns an **objective score (or value)** to each design candidate. The design candidate that obtains the highest (or lowest, when minimizing) score is the **optimum design**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In HCI, the objective can be anything regarded desirable, such as surface features of the interface (e.g., minimal white space) or expected performance of users (e.g., 'task A should be completed as quickly as possible') and so on. Our opinion is that the quality of a interface should be primarly determined by reference to end-users, for example their performance and experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where to obtain a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "While we will later see examples of objective functions, it is good to know that there are many principled (and unprincipled) ways to obtain them:\n",
    "* Literature: A model or theory from prior work\n",
    "* Data-driven approach: Use e.g. statistics or machine learning to obtain a model from data\n",
    "* Standards, guidelines, and design patterns\n",
    "* Heuristics, such as guidelines and best-found practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "After a task has been defined, a solver should be chosen and tuned to attack its instances. We will later look at solvers and their different properties. The process of 'solving' can be intuitively understood as search for highest peaks (when maximizing), or lowest valleys (when minimizing), in a vast 'landscape':\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/landscapes.png\" width=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### A word about 'optimality'\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial optimization offers a rigorous yet actionable (executable) definition of optimality: To say that a design is optimal is to say that in the defined set of candidate designs, there is no better design (global optimum has been identified). \n",
    "\n",
    "The word 'optimal' is **overused and misused**. In order to claim that a design is optimal, one *must* answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. The best out of which options? (design space)\n",
    "2. The best for what? (design objectives and task instance)\n",
    "3. The best with what guarantees? (search method)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer to the last question defines the 'flavor' of optimality. A design is **globally optimal** when the search method *guarantees* that it achieves the highest objective value in the whole design space. Such guarantees are offered by exhaustive search and exact methods (e.g., integer programming). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we do not have access to those methods, for example because the complexity of the objective function, we cannot claim global optimality. A design is **approximately optimal** when its objective value is within some margin of the optimal design, or when there is a good chance that only marginally better designs exist. When we have multiple objectives, defining optimality is trickier, a topic we will revisit."

The problem would be harder if we did not ignore some other important design considerations, such as grouping of elements. Also, our solver was incredibly wasteful.

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/overview.png\" width=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search space\n",
    "\n",
    "*Search space* is a representation, in code, of the feasible set for a search algorithm. [Some representations are illustrated here](imgs/representations.png). The choice of representation affects:\n",
    "* availability of sovers; for example, the formulation of the concept of search neighborhood, which is exploited in local search methods\n",
    "* computational efficiency\n",
    "* ease of extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we use a *list* representation of layouts, that has its own pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "As said, **an objective function** maps a design candidate $x \\in \\mathbf{X}$ to a real-valued predictor:\n",
    "$f: \\mathbf{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "To be relevant for interaction design, this function should quantify an aspect like usability, enjoyability, ergonomics, or errors. Several objectives may need to be combined for reasonable results ([example: web layout design; Todi et al. DIS 2016](imgs/multi-objective.png)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several models and heuristics are available to this end. This table shows 11 examples spanning task, cognitive, motor, and aesthetic aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Example objective |  Application ref.  |\n",
    "|----------|------|-------|\n",
    "| Fitts' law  |  Minimize finger travel times | Zhai et al. UIST 2000 |\n",
    "| Search-Decide-Point | Minimize visual search and selection time in menus  | Bailly et al. UIST 2013 |\n",
    "| Coherence  |  Ensure related items are close to each other | Bailly et al. UIST 2013 |\n",

    "**Subjective goals and preferences** can be dealt with by two main means: (1) by calibrating weights manually to correspond to some distribution of preferences, be they designers' or users'; (2) using machine learning to parametrize models to best correspond with individual priorities expressed in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of modeling formalism affects two critical goals:\n",
    "1. **Predictive validity**: Prediction of desired outcomes in interaction \n",
    "2. **Computational efficiency**:  Minimum time to evaluate a design for a chosen solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some modeling formalisms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristics** are rules of thumb used in design,  such as 'white space should be minimized'.  Since most heuristics are 'weak' (carry little information), multiple are needed. This leads to the problem of **conflict resolution**: how to weigh the contribution of one heuristic against another. Another issue of heuristics is their questionable validity. (Note: not to be confused with heuristic optimization methods.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics** are expressed as a real-valued functions that capture some feature of a design and link it to predictions of outcomes to users. Example: Overplotting metrics in the design of information visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression** offers a more expressive yet quickly computable mathematical form of cost functions:\n",
    "$y = f (\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{\\beta} ) + \\epsilon$ . \n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulator-based models** are step-wise executed functions $M$ that map the model parameters $\\theta$ to data. In HCI, the parameters $\\theta$ capture both parameters of the user and those of the task or context. Simulators are **generative models** that predict not only the outcomes of interaction but intermediate steps, or the process of interaction. A simulator may address multiple design objectives in a coherent manner that require less weight-tuning. However, they are non-linear and significantly more expensive to execute, ruling out exact methods (e.g, integer programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is a vast number of machine learning of different types available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task instance\n",
    "\n",
    "*Task instance* refers to task-specific input values to the design task and objective function, such as:\n",
    "* How many or which elements to place and their properties (sizes, colors etc) \n",
    "* Relative importance of given design objectives (e.g,. is usability more critical than security?)\n",
    "* Inputs expressing properties of targeted user groups, such as goals, capabilities, and interaction styles of users (e.g., what do they want to achieve with the interface?)\n",
    "* Constraints of the interface (e.g., screen resolution, input method).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task instance is specified by designer or inferred from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization method\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern methods in combinatorial optimization can be divided into two main classes. An overview of [optimization methods in engineering optimization](imgs/optimizationmethods.png) is offered in Rao 2009:\n",
    "1. **Black-box or heuristic methods** do not necessitate assumptions about  the objective function, but rather consider it as a black-box -- like an oracle -- that tells them the objective value of a given candidate it has generated.  \n",
    "2. **Exact methods** such as integer programming offer mathematical guarantees for solutions but insist on analysis of the objective function for revealing simplifications and links to known tasks in the optimization literature. Integer programming is covered in the other part of the day.\n",

(2) The code could also be optimized (e.g., parallelization, precomputed lookup tables for objective function, ...). This might bring x10 or even x100 speed-ups. (3) One could also use domain knowledge to rewrite the optimizer, such as exploiting the groups of associated elements as units. (4) How about reformulating the problem for exact methods, such as integer programming (see Anna's notebook)? (5) The hyperparameters of the method might be tuned. (6) We could look at diagnostics telling something about how the optimizer works and what the search landscape looks like. We here look at the first option (heuristics).\n",

Often heuristics are problem-specific and cannot be transfered from one problem to another. The essence of heuristic methods is search by *trial and error* (Glover 1986). Heuristic methods are practical for non-linear problems where analytical solutions might not be obtained, in theory or in practice.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Some (not all) heuristic methods can get easily 'trapped' in a local optimum. According to a loose definition, all heuristic methods are metaheuristic, too. According to a stricter definition, metaheuristics are optimization methods that modify their use of heuristic methods as optimization progresses: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"master strategy that guides and modifies other heuristics to produce solutions beyond those that are normally generated in a quest for local optimality\" (Glover and Laguna 1997)\n",
    "\n",
    "> “A metaheuristic is formally defined as an iterative generation process which guides a subordinate heuristic by combin- ing intelligently different concepts for ex- ploring and exploiting the search space, learning strategies are used to struc- ture information in order to find effici- ently near-optimal solutions.” (Osman and Laporte 1996).\n",

    "### Some general strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intensification and diversification** (a.k.a. exploitation and exploration): [Diversification](imgs/diversification.png) means generating diverse solutions to explore the global search space, and [intensification](imgs/intensification.png) focusing on a local region to find the best solution in that region. Controlling the balance between these strategies improves the rate of convergence. However, this never guarantees finding the global optimum. Simulated annealing belongs includes hyper parameters (temperature) to control how to diversify/intensify search with time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory:** One common strategy is to keep a memory of good or bad previously seen solutions. [Tabu search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search) is a classic example ([illustration](imgs/tabu.png)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Construction:** Instead of sampling full solutions, one can try to combine element-level ideas from previously visited solutions. A method can try to build a proxy model of the domain to 'guess' where previously unseen good solutions might be (e.g., ant colonies implement a pheromone function). ([Example ACO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NtB7PQxizw).)\n",

    "* Problems are high-dimensional (think: a web layout or office tool)\n",

    "* Changing criteria for good design (think: a designer ideating)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reduced basis technique\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know that some *n* good designs exist, we can use this information in many ways. (1) We can seed the optimizer with this information. (2) We could also try to solve a simpler version of the problem where we try to find a linear combination of the existing designs:\n",

    "## Sensitivity analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal design is a *particular* set of design choices. However, in some cases we would like to know if it is specific to the task instance. How much would a change in the input parameters 'perturb' the best design? In other words, how sensitive is it to the underlying task? Consider the Qwerty keyboard: It is an acceptable design for English, but if we assume a different user population, how much would it change? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Robust optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust optimization takes a more proactive approach to optimization. We generate a series of solutions and improve them to make the progressively less sensitive to task instances. We call the set of task instances a **scenario set**. The most robust design is the one that achieves the best objective value across the whole set. \n",

    "In real-world design problems, objectives often conflict with each other. \n",
    "A perfect multi-objective solution that is the best in terms of all objectives is mostly unattainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pareto optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "We must first revisit our what 'optimality' means in the case of multi-objective optimization. We need a new concept: A **pareto-optimal design** is one which cannot be changed to make one objective better without making at least one other objective worse off. [Pareto frontier](imgs/pareto.jpg) is the set of all pareto optimal designs. Finding Pareto frontiers is useful for making informed choices in design, focusing on the particular parameters that differentiate designs (as opposed to all of them).\n",

    "Thus far, we have used the **weighted sum approach**, which collapses the multiple objectives into a single function by the use of weights.

Trying to fix a problem by changing a weight can cause unwanted [side effects](http://i.imgur.com/x501fi0.gifv). \n",

A **minimum-effort optimization** approach tries to infer some the design task and then reacts, e.g. by suggesting redesigns.\n",

Although the work described here has been successful with basic sensory-motor models and is expanding to cognitive aspects, there is still a long way to go to address the physical, social, and cultural factors of interaction that are key to emerging topics like AI, the Internet of Things, and social media. Finally, which aspects of design should be automated and which should be left to the designer? Carelessly designed tools will lead to deskilling and avoidance of responsibility, thereby undermining the potential benefits of optimization. If such problems are solved, the wider implications of this approach are intriguing. (Oulasvirta, IEEE Computer 2017)\n",

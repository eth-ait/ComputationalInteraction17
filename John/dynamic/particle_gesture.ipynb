    "The Kalman filter used the normal distribution to model all of the uncertainty in the system. This is great for computational efficiency, since the updates are simple linear transforms. It is also inferentially efficient; given only a small amount of evidence the Kalman filter will converge quickly compared to other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it has several significant drawbacks, which make it difficult to apply directly to infer *gestures* from observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kalman filter drawbacks\n",
    "* the **dynamics** have to be linear: we can't have complicated dynamic models (although we can linearise at each time step).\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't make much sense for tracking complex gesture trajectories; a dynamic model for a complete gesture is rarely going to be linear. We might want to be able to learn complex dynamics using a deep network, for example, and then plug them into a probabilistic filter. A Kalman filter does not support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* all of the **uncertainty** must be normal: so we can't track multiple modes, for example, because a normal distribution has exactly one mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an object disappearing behind an obstruction which could reappear on either side; the Kalman filter can only spread out the distribution over the whole area, with an expected location in the middle of the obstacle! We would like to instead be able to track the two possibilities here by splitting up the hypotheses. \n",

    "Very often in HCI we encounter problems with a combination of discrete variables and continuous ones.\n",
    "This is critical in gesture recognition for example; at any point in time, our hypotheses might be split among multiple possible gestures with different spatial distributions. Being able to represent the combination of discrete + continuous states is critical. (**Kalman filter banks** are an alternative approach, which explicitly maintain the competing hypotheses as separate Kalman filters).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, the **hidden Markov model**, formerly a key algorithm in speech recognition, is to discrete state tracking what the Kalman filter is to continuous state tracking. The HMM can track discrete hidden states easily (with discrete or continuous observation space), but cannot track continuous variables on its own.\n"

    "* **Sample-based:** Instead of trying to represent the PDFs of our distributions, which could be any function that integrates to unity, we represent **distributions** using **samples** from those distributions (i.e. it is a **sequential Monte Carlo** method; we use samples to represent distributions). We choose some fixed number of particles $N_s$ and have a set of particles $S_t = \\{ x^{1}_t, x^{2}_t, \\dots, x^{N_s}_t \\}$. At any time point, our belief is captured by this sample set.\n",

Likewise, for any sample, we can compute the corresponding observation by applying an arbitrary function $g(x_t)$ to each sample independently. There are **no** restrictions on the form of $f({\\bf x_t})$ and $g({\\bf x_t})$.\n",
    "* **Arbitrary distribution:** Our uncertainty is captured by the locations of the set of particles in the state space; they are samples from our current posterior. We do not have an explicit parametric form for the distribution; samples are all that we have. Therefore there are no restrictions on the form of the distribution; it can be multi-modal, heavy-tailed etc. \n",
    "* **No explicit likelihood:** We don't explicitly compute the likelihood of observations, but instead we apply some weighting function to the particles and then normalise these weights to approximate the likelihood. This means we only have to find a reasonable weighting function, and not a true likelihood.\n",
    "* **Importance sampled** We **resample** particles which are likely after an observation, and discard those which are unlikely. This is **importance resampling**. Without this step, particles would quickly diffuse into very unlikely parts of the space. **Importance resampling** continuously adapts the particles to cover likely portions of the space.\n",

    "### Scope and limitations\n",
    "#### Scope\n",
    "* Probabilistic filters can be applied to many problems in HCI. Typically, if a process unfolds over time and there is uncertainty, a probabilistic filter is a strong candidate for inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The fact that inference is performed over time is a potential advantage over \"static\" classification approaches, as feedback can be generated on the fly, instead only after completion of an action. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the specific context of gestures, the ability to infer the start and end-point of gestures can solve the \"segmentation problem\" or \"gesture spotting problem\" that is often awkward and leads to kludges like button presses to segment actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probabilistic motion models can easily be linked to higher-order probabilistic models which infer long-term actions on the part of the user. Because everything is a probability distribution, there is a simple common basis for integrating such models. This, for example, can include language models which estimate a distribution over text that is likely to be entered given both user input and a statistical model of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "* PFs can be computationally intensive to run. \n",
    "* Curse-of-dimensionality can make the attractive simplicity of PFs work poorly in practice as the state space expands (although often better than you might expect).\n",
    "* Sometimes the inverse probability model can be hard to formulate. Conversely, it is sometimes very much easier.\n",
    "* Particle filters are simple and elegant, but inferentially weak.\n",
    "* Kalman filters are rigid and restrictive, but very inferentially efficient.\n",
    "* Hybrid approaches (Ensemble Kalman filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, hybrid particle/Kalman filters, Rao-Blackwellized filters) can trade these qualities off, but they aren't off the shelf solutions (i.e. you need an expert!).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "#### Basic\n",
    "* Read the [Condensation paper](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231b_spring1415/papers/isard-blake-98.pdf).\n",
    "* Read [the Kalman filter in pictures](http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/)\n",
    "* Watch [the particle filter without equations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUkBa1zMKv4)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced\n",
    "* [A technical but succinct and clear explanation of the particle filter](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eorhan/notes/particle-filtering.pdf)\n",
    "* [A bibliography of particle filter papers](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/smc_resources.html)\n",

    "### Future of probabilistic filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learned models\n",
    "\n",
    "Much use of probabilistic filters has depended on strong mathematical models of the fundamental process. For example, in rocket science, sophisticated physics models were used to specify the Kalman filters used for stable control. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is becoming increasingly possible to **infer** these models from observations. Techniques such as deep learning (for example variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks) make it possible to learn very sophisticated *generative models* from observations of\n",
    "data.  These models can be dropped into probabilistic filters to produce robust inferential engines for user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "As an illustrative example, we recently built a touch pose estimator to estimate the pose of a finger from a capacitive sensor array (as found on a touch screen). We trained DCNN to predict finger pose from sensor images (inverse model), a separate deconvolutional CNN to predict sensor images from finger poses (forward model) and then fused these using a particle filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/fwd_inv.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This combined model gives substantial robustness, and we were able to introduce a simple dynamics model, which filters out completely implausible movements.\n",

    "    \n",
    "This is enough to answer some interesting questions; for example, can we model differences in the way keys are pressed based on the distribution of inter-key times? Or more precisely, can we infer a **probability distribution** over users that might be generating a timing sequence and update that as we see more keystrokes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we could see if the type of key hit (e.g. space versus letter, or left side versus right side) influences the timing of the **next** keystroke, and build a predictive model to infer the likely next time to key impact. This could be used to optimise keyboard layouts (as you will see later in the week).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are very ambitiuous, we could try and recover the keystrokes themselves from timing alone. There probably isn't enough information to do this, at least without very large user-specific datasets and a robust **language model**, but we could probably identify unusual or special keys (e.g. identify `Space` or `Enter` or `Esc` in the timing stream).\n",

This explictly models dependencies between **random variables** (i.e. ones we don't know the value of precisely) and inference can be performed on the entire graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In CS terms, we are writing expressions down without fixing the variables, and then allowing the distribution of the values to be inferred when we observe data.** This inference process narrows down the likely range a random variable could take on (hopefully!).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **probabilistic graphical model**, some nodes in the graph are **observed** -- that is we know their state because we have explicity measured it, and others are **unobserved** -- we know (or have guessed) the form of their distribution but not the parameters of that distribution. Some dependencies are deterministic (i.e. fully defined by the values of their parents), while others are stochastic (i.e. are characerised by distributions). We can infer the **posterior** distribution of unobserved nodes by integrating over the possible values that could have occured given the observed values.\n",

There are many techinques to do this efficiently, as the naive sampling methods become very inefficient in high dimensional spaces (i.e. $N$ must be very large to reliably sample the space). \n",

    "One of these techniques is *Markov chain Monte Carlo* (MCMC) constructs random walks which \"wander\" about in probablity distributions in a way that makes samples drawn from them represent the true distribution correctly.

    "Details on how this can be done technically in are explained in [these lecture notes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/Courses/BDA/bda_mcmc.pdf) by Chris Holmes. We'll be using the PyMC software to do the heavy lifting.\n",

These are implemented in PyMC3, as well as in the MCMC system **STAN**, and can work very well in otherwise intractably high-dimensional spaces.\n",

This means early samples from the distribution might be unreasonably dense in very low probability regions in the posterior. How \"good\" the Markov chain is at sampling from the posterior is called **mixing**; some MCMC setups may mix very badly until they get warmed up.\n",

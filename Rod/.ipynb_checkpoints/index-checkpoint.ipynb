    "### Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of today is to get hands on experience in applying Bayesian, probabilistic models to HCI. The focus is on specific, practical examples rather than theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover **two topics**, with a mix of practical and lecture material. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct links to the notebooks for each of the summer school topics are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Static models: Inferring Typing Behaviour](static/mcmc_typing.ipynb) This section looks at building probabilistic Bayesian models of typing behaviour, and inferring parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic models: [Tracking Cursors](dynamic/kalman_filter.ipynb) and [Recognising gestures](dynamic/particle_gesture.ipynb) This section looks at building dynamic probabilistic models that can track states over time, including estimating cursor movement with noisy, partial measurements and spotting and tracking gestures.\n",
